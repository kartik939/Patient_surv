This is a project based on IOT which is basically used for medical and healthcare.
The solution to this problem is very simple.
The medical staff and the doctors should be alerted for the recently happened cardiac arrest through a distress message (also called SOS).
This message will be sent with the help of concept of IOT.
The sensor connected to the heart sensing machine will sense any abnormal reading of heart and alert the medical staff with immediate effect.
This project may save many lives.
